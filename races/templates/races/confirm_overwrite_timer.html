    <h4>Existing Timed Result Found</h4>

    <p>
        You already have a timed result recorded for this race.
        <br>
        <strong>Starting a new timer will force you to overwrite that result when the race is finished or discard this race timing result.</strong>
        <br> 
        <br>
        If you are not expecting this, then it may be worth cancelling and confirming you are starting a timer on the correct race !
